# 100 Days of AI Challenge

Welcome to the **100 Days of AI** challenge! This repository will document my journey of learning and applying Artificial Intelligence over the next 100 days. Here, you will find my daily progress, resources, projects, and the skills I acquire throughout this challenge.

## Challenge Details

The 100 Days of AI challenge is inspired by the 100 Days of Code challenge. The goal is to dedicate at least one hour every day to studying and working on AI-related projects for 100 days straight.

### Start Date

[2024-05-19]

### End Date

[2024-08-25]

## Learning Blocks

To structure my learning, I've divided the challenge into several key blocks, each focusing on different aspects of AI. Here's the plan:

### Block 1: Foundations of AI (Days 1-10)
- **Introduction to AI and Machine Learning**
- **History and Ethics of AI**
- **Basic Statistics and Probability**
- **Python for Data Science**

### Block 2: Data Preprocessing and Visualization (Days 11-20)
- **Data Collection and Cleaning**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- **Data Visualization Techniques**
- **Using Pandas and Matplotlib**

### Block 3: Machine Learning Algorithms (Days 21-40)
- **Supervised Learning**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - K-means Clustering
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- **Model Evaluation and Tuning**

### Block 4: Deep Learning (Days 41-60)
- **Introduction to Neural Networks**
- **Building Neural Networks with TensorFlow and Keras**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

### Block 5: AI in Practice (Days 61-80)
- **Building AI Projects**
- **AI for Image Recognition**
- **AI for Text Analysis**
- **AI in Healthcare and Finance**

### Block 6: Advanced Topics and Applications (Days 81-100)

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
- **AI Ethics and Bias**
- **Future Trends in AI**

## Skills Gained

By the end of the 100 days, I aim to have gained the following skills:

- **Proficiency in Python for AI and Data Science**
- **Ability to preprocess and visualize data effectively**
- **Understanding of key machine learning algorithms**
- **Experience in building and tuning machine learning models**
- **Knowledge of deep learning techniques and frameworks**
- **Capability to apply AI in various domains**
- **Awareness of ethical considerations in AI development**
-
